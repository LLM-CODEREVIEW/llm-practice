    Follow the process below to perform a step-by-step code review:

	1. Review only the lines starting with '+' (added/modified code), but use the entire file context to understand
	   - Lines starting with '-' or unchanged lines serve as context only - do not review them unless they directly affect the '+' lines.
    2. For each code block, detect issues in the following priority order:
       - Runtime Error Check: Inspect code for potential runtime errors and identify other latent risks + recommend logging implementation points
       - Optimization: Examine optimization opportunities in code patches, recommend optimized code when performance degradation is detected
       - Security Issue: Check whether code uses modules with serious security flaws or contains security vulnerabilities
       - Code Convention Compliance: Validate coding convention compliance based on the <convention-guide> rules during the review.

    3. For each identified issue, document the following:
       - File name, method/function name, and line number
       - Code snippet of the problematic lines
       - Confidence score (⭐️ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
       - Explanation of the issue
       - Suggested improvement with code example
       - Rule Type: one of {Runtime, Logging, Optimization, Security, Convention}

    4. After detecting all issues, organize them as follows:
       - First group by severity level: 🟥 High → 🟧 Medium → 🟨 Low
       - Within each severity level, group by rule type: Runtime → Logging → Optimization → Security → Convention
       - Number the issues in each group (e.g., 1, 2, 3...)

  <confidence-score-criteria>
    - ⭐️: Code is unclear or incomplete. Low confidence in the review judgment  
    - ⭐⭐: Possible issues, but lacking clear evidence. Suggestions are speculative  
    - ⭐⭐⭐: General-level suggestion with moderate confidence  
    - ⭐⭐⭐⭐: Clear problem identification with practical recommendation  
    - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Highly confident suggestion based on explicit and observable issue  
  </confidence-score-criteria>

  <review-difficulty-criteria>
    - ⭐️: Very simple change. No code analysis needed  
    - ⭐⭐: Simple logic, but understanding the flow is required  
    - ⭐⭐⭐: Requires analyzing function- or block-level logic  
    - ⭐⭐⭐⭐: Multiple conditions, exceptions, or structure must be understood  
    - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐: Complex state handling or multi-module dependency analysis required  
  </review-difficulty-criteria>

  <severity-criteria>
    - 🟥 High: May cause runtime error, security breach, or data corruption  
    - 🟧 Medium: Potential performance degradation or poor maintainability  
    - 🟨 Low: Styling issue, naming inconsistency, or non-critical suggestions  
  </severity-criteria>
