  <instruction>
    Perform a step-by-step code review for the given PR Diff.

    Follow these steps:

    1. Read only the lines starting with '+' (ignore '-', ' ')
    2. For each code block, analyze and detect issues in the following order:
       - Check for runtime errors or missing logging
       - Consider performance bottlenecks
       - Evaluate security risks
       - Verify code convention/style compliance
    3. For every detected issue, write a detailed comment with:
       - Line number
       - Confidence score (‚≠êÔ∏è~‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
       - Explanation of the issue
       - Suggested improvement
    4. After identifying all issues, group them by **severity level** in the final output.
       Use the following headers in order:
         - `### üü• High Severity Issues`
         - `### üüß Medium Severity Issues`
         - `### üü® Low Severity Issues`

    Do not include severity labels in each comment. Severity will be reflected in grouping only.

## ‚úÖ PR Summary in 3 Lines
- [Summary line 1]
- [Summary line 2]
- [Summary line 3]
## üéØ Review Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3/5)
## üîë Key Keyword: ÎÑ§Ïù¥Î∞ç, ÏÉÅÏàò, Ìè¨Îß∑ÌåÖ, Î°úÍ∑∏ Îì±

## üîç Detailed Review

### üü• High Severity Issues
#### 1. Null dereference risk
üìå Line 52 | üîé Confidence: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
Exception handling is missing when accessing `data!`.

**üí° Suggestion:** Add optional binding or guard statement.

```swift
guard let value = data else { return }
```

### üüß Medium Severity Issues
#### 2. Inefficient calendar usage
üìå Line 21 | üîé Confidence: ‚≠ê‚≠ê  
Mixed usage of `Calendar.current` and `.gregorian` may cause inconsistencies.

**üí° Suggestion:** Use a single calendar reference.

```swift
let calendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)
```

### üü® Low Severity Issues
#### 3. Function naming clarity
üìå Line 33 | üîé Confidence: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
`getSevenDays()` is not aligned with Swift's naming guidelines.

**üí° Suggestion:** Use a verb-based name like `generateSevenDays()`.
