    - ‚≠êÔ∏è: Code is unclear or incomplete. Low confidence in the review judgment

    - ‚≠êÔ∏è: Very simple change. No code analysis needed  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Simple logic, but understanding the flow is required  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Requires analyzing function- or block-level logic  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Multiple conditions, exceptions, or structure must be understood

    - üü• High: May cause runtime error, security breach, or data corruption

  <instruction>
    Perform a step-by-step code review for the given PR Diff.

    Follow these steps:

    1. Read only the lines starting with '+' (ignore '-', ' ')
    2. For each code block, analyze and detect issues in the following order:
       - Runtime Error or missing Logging
       - Performance Optimization
       - Security Issue
       - Code Convention Violation
    3. For each detected issue, write a detailed comment with:
       - Line number
       - File name
       - Confidence score (‚≠êÔ∏è~‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
       - Explanation of the issue
       - Suggested improvement
       - Rule Type: One of Runtime, Logging, Optimization, Security, Convention
    4. After identifying all issues, group them first by **severity level**, and within each severity group:
       - Group by Rule Type in this order: Runtime ‚Üí Logging ‚Üí Optimization ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Convention
       - Within each Rule Type group, number the issues starting from 1

    Use the following headers in order:
      - `### üü• High Severity Issues`
      - `### üüß Medium Severity Issues`
      - `### üü® Low Severity Issues`

    Use a secondary heading (### [RuleType]) to separate rule types inside each severity section.
    Use `#### [Number]. Summary` for each issue.

- [Summary line 2]
- [Summary line 3]
## üéØ Review Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3/5)
## üîë Key Keywords: naming, constant, formatting, logging

## üîç Detailed Review

### üü• High Severity Issues
### [Runtime]
#### 1. Null dereference risk
üìå File: `UserManager.swift` | Line: 52 | üîé Confidence: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
Missing exception handling when accessing optional value. May cause a crash.

**üí° Suggestion:** Use `guard let` or conditional to safely unwrap.

### [Convention]
#### 1. Unclear function naming
üìå File: `CalendarUtils.swift` | Line: 18 | üîé Confidence: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
The function name uses a noun form which is ambiguous about its behavior.

**üí° Suggestion:** Use an action-based name like `generateSevenDays()` instead of `getSevenDays()`.

### üüß Medium Severity Issues
### [Optimization]
#### 1. Redundant computation inside loop
üìå File: `LayoutHelper.swift` | Line: 30 | üîé Confidence: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  
Repeatedly calling the same expression inside the loop can degrade performance.

**üí° Suggestion:** Move the expression outside the loop and reuse the value.

### üü® Low Severity Issues
