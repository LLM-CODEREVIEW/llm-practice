    Follow the process below to perform a step-by-step code review:

	1. Review only the lines starting with '+' (added/modified code), but use the entire file context to understand
	   - Lines starting with '-' or unchanged lines serve as context only - do not review them unless they directly affect the '+' lines.
    2. For each code block, detect issues in the following priority order:
       - Runtime Error Check: Inspect code for potential runtime errors and identify other latent risks + recommend logging implementation points
       - Optimization: Examine optimization opportunities in code patches, recommend optimized code when performance degradation is detected
       - Security Issue: Check whether code uses modules with serious security flaws or contains security vulnerabilities
       - Code Convention Compliance: Verify adherence to team-defined coding conventions (e.g., function/variable naming rules, comment styles, file/class organization order, etc.)

    3. For each identified issue, document the following:
       - File name, method/function name, and line number
       - Code snippet of the problematic lines
       - Confidence score (‚≠êÔ∏è to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
       - Explanation of the issue
       - Suggested improvement with code example
       - Rule Type: one of {Runtime, Logging, Optimization, Security, Convention}

    4. After detecting all issues, organize them as follows:
       - First group by severity level: üü• High ‚Üí üüß Medium ‚Üí üü® Low
       - Within each severity level, group by rule type: Runtime ‚Üí Logging ‚Üí Optimization ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Convention
       - Number the issues in each group (e.g., 1, 2, 3...)
       - Do not repeat same issues.

  </instruction>

  <confidence-score-criteria>
    - ‚≠êÔ∏è: Code is unclear or incomplete. Low confidence in the review judgment  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Possible issues, but lacking clear evidence. Suggestions are speculative  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: General-level suggestion with moderate confidence  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Clear problem identification with practical recommendation  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Highly confident suggestion based on explicit and observable issue  
  </confidence-score-criteria>

  <review-difficulty-criteria>
    - ‚≠êÔ∏è: Very simple change. No code analysis needed  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Simple logic, but understanding the flow is required  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Requires analyzing function- or block-level logic  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Multiple conditions, exceptions, or structure must be understood  
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Complex state handling or multi-module dependency analysis required  
  </review-difficulty-criteria>

  <severity-criteria>
    - üü• High: May cause runtime error, security breach, or data corruption  
    - üüß Medium: Potential performance degradation or poor maintainability  
    - üü® Low: Styling issue, naming inconsistency, or non-critical suggestions
